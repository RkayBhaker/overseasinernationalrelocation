            Moving overseas can be a dream come true for many people. After all, who wouldn’t want to leave their everyday life behind and experience something new and exciting? However, moving to another country might not always be as easy as one may think. In fact, it is a lot more challenging than most people anticipate.

            An overseas move involves several steps that are not so simple as they appear on first glance. You need to find appropriate accommodations; set up utilities; get registered in your new country; get your visa approved; pack everything you own into suitcases; arrange the shipping of your things; sort out customs formalities when they arrive in the new country… The list goes on.

          In general, there are three main types of shipping services you can use when shipping from the United States to another country: air freight, sea freight, and hybrid shipping. Air freight is the fastest option, but it’s also the most expensive. Depending on the volume and weight of your shipment, you may have to use a Customs broker to clear it through customs. Sea freight is the most common shipping method for moving large items overseas. It’s also the cheapest option, but it’s slow. The average transit time is 30–40 days. Sea freight is a lot more flexible than air freight, and you can arrange to have your shipment broken up into smaller shipments that are scheduled to arrive at different times. Hybrid shipping is a mix of both sea freight and air freight. It’s generally used when you need to move something that’s too big or too heavy for sea freight, but it’s too time-sensitive to wait for air freight. Hybrid shipping is an excellent choice for fragile items that need extra protection during transit.
